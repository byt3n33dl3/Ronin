CHANGELOG

/--------------\
| Version 2.75 |
\--------------/
General:
- Various improvements and optimizations.
- Various files may have comments such as: // noinspection JSUndefinedPropertyAssignment
  This type of comment is intended for PyCharm to ignore certain warnings and errors.
- Various todo notes have been added to the files for future versions. These also function
  as a roadmap, to see what's planned in upcoming releases.
- Added another command to run during post-exploitation scenarios for WordPress.
- Added some other commands and resources for post-exploitation in general.
- Formatted license slightly so that it has appropriate linebreaks.
- Added "requirements.txt" and "requirements-all-libraries-used.txt" files for easier
  dependency installation with python pip.

Joomla backdoor:
- Now checks if the "c" or "c64" parameters are set before executing any code.
- Base64 encoded payloads are now, also supported via the "c64" HTTP parameter.
- All error reporting has been disabled for this backdoor.
- For added stealth, this backdoor/plugin can e.g. be encoded. (Refer to PHP files.)
- Additional comments about advanced usage can also be found in the PHP files.
- For changing how the plugin itself works and is referenced within Joomla,
  please refer to the helloshell.xml file. Note: Almost everything can easily be changed
  in these files, except the directory name which must also be renamed in xsser.py.

JavaScript payloads:
- Added a new educational and generic payload. This has not been implemented into xsser.py yet.
- Versions standardized across all payloads.
- SetCookie() now uses non-deprecated functions.
- The "cookie match" now uses regular expressions to properly check if the attacker's cookie is present.
- Joomla payloads now have a "self-removal" option for the initial injection.
  Note: This only seems to work when executed manually at the moment.
- WordPress payloads have been updated to use "nonce" instead of "_wpnonce", as this was changed since
  last year. A future version may be used to generate the correct payload, depending on whether a very
  old version of WordPress is in use, or a currently up to date version.
- The prepopulated forms in the WordPress payloads have been updated, to accommodate source code changes
  since last year.
- setTimeout() was updated so it is used in a better, and more maintainable manner.
- Header sections are now more standardized, in terms of design and layout.

XSSER:
- Switched from gnome-terminal to xterm due to several configuration options being deprecated.
- Removed the redundant requirements description. Please refer to the README.md file instead.
- Removed "written for", "tested on", "tested against", and "changelog". Refer to README.md
- Added new function which gets all assigned IP addresses and lets the user choose which to listen on.
  This minimizes the time that the user has to spend on typing the IP address to listen on and serve files from.
  -- vBSEO and BetterWPSecurity Exploits: PHP and JS filenames are now generated in a more random manner.
- All JavaScript payloads are now minified (comments and extra newlines removed) and base64 encoded during run-time.
- Converted all "os.system(curl)" requests to python requests with 3 second timeout instead.
- Converted all "httplib.HTTPConnection()" requests to python 'requests' with 3 second timeout.
- Replaced all "%s" with "{}".format()
- Joomla "Hello_Shell" backdoor (zip) file, is now automatically generated each time the xsser.py tool runs.
  Note: If you make a change to any of the files in the Hello_Shell directory, simply exit xsser.py and run
  it again to automatically create the zip file.
- Experimental POST-request handler implemented into the generic web server. This is currently not used.

Testing:
- All exploits and payloads have been tested against the latest application versions, except vBulletin 4.X.X
  which is not compatible with the now deprecated vBSEO plugin.

/-------------\
| Version 2.5 |
\-------------/
- WordPress Theme and Plugin injection are not using a hardcoded hostname anymore. (TARGETWEBSITE is now
  properly replaced)
- Removed deprecated code for WordPress Theme and Plugin injection, so that the user is not asked twice to
  provide hostname.
- Added dirtycow 32-bit and 64-bit source code files to the web servers. https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40616/
  Note: This seems to cause kernel panic after the user quits the shell.
- Removed --title from gnome-terminal commands as this option is no longer supported.
- Notifications:
  -- Added notifications to the console / web server log.
  -- Added a popup notification with some ASCII text, when the JavaScript has been fully executed by the target.
  -- Added a voice notification, when the Reverse PHP Shell (Notify) option is used, and the associated code
     in the PHP shell connects back to the attacker's machine.
- Automation:
  -- vBulletin and WordPress shells are now automatically activated when the JavaScript is triggered.
- New attack vectors:
  -- Joomla "SecurityCheck" Addon - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39879/ - EDB ID: 39879
